            <h3>Sports Opportunities</h3>
            <img src="images\sports.jpg" alt="picture">
            <p>Sports are a crucial part of a student’s growth and development. They help in the development of mental health and physical fitness of the body. Through participation in sports and games, a student gains various skills, experience and confidence that are helpful for developing their personality. </p>
            <p>Students get a chance to work on their physical and mental abilities to achieve goals in their life. We can realise the importance of sports in our daily life through a variety of national and international sports events organised all over the world where different players represent their countries and showcase their sporting capabilities. 
             <p>Sports teaches students to be emotionally strong. Most of the students often have to deal with some of the other emotional issues in their life, either at home or in school. The skill they develop through sports helps them to accept all defeats as well as wins. Hence, students who loves games and sports are in a much better position to deal with tough situations.</p>
             <p>The students who are very much engaged in sports activities have a bonding capability. Here, they have to work as a team, which teaches them how to enhance a social relationship- which is also an important parameter of life.</p>

                Additionally, the learning of a student starts from the primary level and sports help students develop a strong mental and physical foundation from an early age. </p>
